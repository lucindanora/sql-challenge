# sql-challenge
For this challenge, we were requested to design tables to hold data from 6 CSV files (data file), import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data using pgAdmin tools for PostgreSQL. I utilized in-class work, reviewed videos of class and used the https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/ website to create my ERD. I worked closely with my study group to write the queries and retrieve the requested data.
